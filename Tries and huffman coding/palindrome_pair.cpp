Palindrome Pair
Send Feedback
Given 'n' number of words, you need to find if there exist any two words which can be joined to make a palindrome or any word, which itself is a palindrome.
The function should return either true or false. You don't have to print anything.
Input Format :
The first line of the test case contains an integer value denoting 'n'.

The following contains 'n' number of words each separated by a single space.
Output Format :
The first and only line of output contains true if the conditions described in the task are met and false otherwise.
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
4
abc def ghi cba
Sample Output 1 :
true
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
"abc" and "cba" forms a palindrome
Sample Input 2 :
2
abc def
Sample Output 2 :
false
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
Neither their exists a pair which forms a palindrome, nor any of the words is a palindrome in itself. Hence, the output is 'false.'

Time - O(N * M)
Space - O(N * M)

N - Number of words in the trie 
M - Average word length

The Approach we have taken to implement this problem

The approach we have taken to solve this problem is to store 
the reverse of each of the words in the trie. We then iterate
over the words and search that does the trie contains the same
word or not.

It may happen that some parts of the word or a substring exist
in the trie. We check for the remaining part of the string to 
be a palindrome or not.

Vice versa of the above will also be true, that means, it may
happen that the word in the trie may extend further over
different number of branches, hence we check all the branches
one by one to see if any of the branches make a palindrome


Another Possible Solution could be

First add the reverse of every word in the trie. Then for every word, search it in 
the trie. If you find it, then that means the word was a palindrome itself
and you can return true. If you dont find it, you need the length of the
part that you did find. For example, you're searching for "abcdd" in the
trie, you didn't find a match for "abcdd" but you found the word "abc" in
the trie. Finding "abc" in the trie means that the actual word was "cba"
since we inserted the reverse of every word in the list.

Now, you have the word "abcdd", you found the word "abc" in the trie. If you
can find whether the part of "abcdd" that comes after "abc", i.e. "dd" is a palindrome, you can conclude that concatenating "abcdd" and "cba" will also
give a palindrome. So you can return true. If the part isn't a palindrome, you can move to check for the next word.

If you traverse throught all words without finding a pair of words that combine to form a palindrome or a word that's a 
palindrome by itself, then you can return false
